ELEMENTS OF LEETCODE - Python solutions explained
=================================================
**What**

These learning materials aim to provide explanations to basic algorithms in 
Python and some in C++, including questions on Leetcode and elsewhere.

**Languages**

Python, C++.
The first solution is always in Python, followed by a solution in C++ if available.

**Why**

While the solutions are widely available through different sources, it is a greater
challenge to find the logic behind the provided answers. 

| This resource seeks to provide: 
| -some theoretical background for a topic, 
| -different approaches to the same problem, 
| -short insights into key aspects, 
| -detailed explanations for some problems, 
| -highlight language aspects required for a particular problem. 

**Questions numbering**

The main questions numbering is not the same as on Leetcode but rather topic based.
The Leetcode number appears in parentheses, for example "70. (LC 442) Find All Duplicates in an Array"
indicates that on Leetcode this question is 442.

**How to search for a Leetcode question**

To search for a Leetcode question use the "search docs" field. 
Enter the question number or title as it appears on Leetcode.

**Does the code work**

If the code is marked "LC accepted" (followed by the percentage it scored on time
and space) then it was tested against all Leetcode test cases and passed (at the time). 
Otherwise the code was run against a few test cases which are provided below the code.
